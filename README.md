# Majora-s-Mask-Randomizer-Tracker

I found that all Majora's Mask randomizer map trackers I used were lacking in some way or another. So I decided to make my own as a little side project.

This tracker is completely web based and is inspired Wooferzfg's The Wind Waker randomizer map tracker.

For now this tracker only has an item tracker. In a future update, that I hope to release very soon, I will implement an easy to use map tracker.

Any feedback about layout, user experience, language and/or functionality is appreciated and can be given through the issues tab.
